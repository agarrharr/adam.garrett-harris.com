In my first guest appearance on a podcast, I talked with David "Ledge" Ledgerwood about podcasting, including how I started [Web of Tomorrow](https://www.orbit.fm/weboftomorrow) and what books we've read on [BookBytes](https://www.orbit.fm/bookbytes). We also talk about what it's like to be a full-stack developer and my transition from the front-end to full-stack.
