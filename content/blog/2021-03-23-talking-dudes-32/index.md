On [this episode of Talking Dudes](https://www.orbit.fm/talkingdudes/season3/32), I talk about my morning routine, Jonathan switched jobs during the snowpocalypse, and he's into timed chess.

We actually ended up playing a couple of games of chess right after recording. Spoiler, Jonathan won both games.
