I have been doing therapy via Skype since March instead of in person, and after ten months of opening Skype and calling my therapist manually, I wondered if Skype supported URL schemes. After a quick seach, it turnes out it does. I found them [documented here](http://www.skaip.org/uri-scheme-skype).

In Fantastical (my calendar app of choice), I pasted the following in the URL field: `skype:echo123?call&video=true`, replacing `echo123` with the username of my therapist. It looks like it works on macOS and iOS.

Now, when it's time for therapy to start, I can just click that link.
