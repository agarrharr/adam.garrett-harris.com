I quit my job as a full-stack software engineer back in March 2021. I was burned out, depressed and I didn't enjoy working on back end software. After a year of quarantining at home it felt like I valued different things than the company I worked for and I had zero motivation to work on what I was supposed to work on. That's not a good place to be, so I told my team, they were very understanding, and I took a week off and got a therapist. Eventually I decided that the best thing for me to do was to take a break.

What I've been wanting to do for a while is learn iOS development. But I also needed to finish renovating the main floor of our house so that we can rent it out.

So that's what I did. It took me 4 months to finish the renovation. Then I spent a couple of weeks with my son before school started. And now I'm completely devoted to learning iOS and I couldn't be more excited..
