On [this episode of BookBytes](https://www.orbit.fm/bookbytes/42), Jason and I are joined by a new co-host, [Rizel Bobb-Semple](https://twitter.com/RizelBobb). We talk about race and how to talk about race. We covered issues like privilege, intersectionality, police brutality, and microaggressions.
