Earlier this year, [I took a break from my job to focus on my mental health and to become an iOS developer](https://adam.garrett-harris.com/2021-08-16-learning-ios-development/).

At times I have felt like an imposter and I have loathed my job. At other times I was so excited to go to work or to program something outside of work. I want my next job to be one that I love going to every day, so it makes sense to try to figure out what I will love based on the past. I wrote down a timeline and made notes about the things I liked and didn't like. And I looked for patterns.

It turns out that I love:

- Making **visual interactive apps**
- Working on my own thing
- Teaching others
- Building things or individual consumers, not large businesses

That is why I'm studying to become an iOS developer. It's visual and interactive. I can make my own apps. And I can [teach others](https://adam.garrett-harris.com/2021-08-21-providing-access-to-directories-in-ios-with-bookmarks/) as I learn.
