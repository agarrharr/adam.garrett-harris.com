Earlier this year, [I took a break from my job to focus on my mental health and to become an iOS developer](https://adam.garrett-harris.com/2021-08-16-learning-ios-development/). I wrote out a timeline of my career to see patterns and decide if iOS development makes sense for me.

At times I have felt like an imposter and I have loathed my job. At other times I was so excited to go to work or to program something outside of work. I wanted to understand why. I wrote down a timeline and made notes about the things I liked and didn't like. And I looked for patterns.

It turns out that I love:

- Making **visual interactive apps**
- Working on my own thing
- Teaching others
- Building things or individual consumers, not large businesses

## Long Story Short

- 2006-2010
	- Earned my Computer Science degree and learned PHP web development on the side. I made a lot of **side projects for myself**, my friends, my church and college ministry, a church in North Dakota, my Fraternity, my Computer Science club, and for my job as an academic RL in the dorms. I was obsessed with making websites **on my own**, especially if they were **interactive**. I also created **my own** independent study class on PHP because I wasn't interested in the other CS electives.
- 2010-2012
	- I did web development at a small company. I brought introduced more **interactivity** to the site with AJAX. I also made PHP side projects. And I took on a side project revamping a Classic ASP.NET site.
- 2012-2013
	- I did freelance web development and taught myself responsive web design, git, WordPress development, and how to make cross-platform Cordova **apps**.
	- I started blogging about what I was learning to **teach** others how to make Cordova apps.
- 2013-2014
	- I worked at a small company where I was hired as a PHP developer but ended up being a JavaScript developer. I made a Cordova **app** from scratch.
- 2014-2016
	- I worked at a startup company making **interactive** visualizations for the web.
	- I also started podcasting about web development to help **teach** others.
- 2016-2017
	- At the same company, I switched to working on the mobile web **app** with React.
- 2017-2018
	- I worked at a consulting company, which means I ended up working for 3 different companies over 11 months working mostly on their websites with React.
- 2018-2021
	- I worked as a full-stack software engineer at a larger company. I loved the parts where I was making **interactive** and **visual** things on the web with React but didn't enjoy working on the backend. I also was frustrated when we would implement a cool new feature that was only available on the web, but not in the mobile **apps**.

## Long Story Long

Back around 2006-2010, it made a lot of sense, that if I wanted to make something visual and interactive that my friends and family could use, the best place to make it was on the web. If I made it for the Mac, my family couldn't use it. If I made it for Windows I couldn't use it. Besides, a native desktop app sounded hard and no one would know how to install it. The barrier of entry was too high. The web was the perfect thing. I could just send a link and show it to anybody. They didn't have to install anything and my UI wasn't limited by what the platform offers. Websites could be so much more visual.

I finally got a smartphone after I got married in 2010 and I had a lot of app ideas like always, but the web was what I knew, so building apps would have to wait. I probably played around with downloading Eclipse and building Android apps, but it still felt very daunting. In 2013 or 2014, a client of mine asked if I could make an Android/iPhone app for them. Intrigued by the idea and not wanting to disappoint them, I said yes and learned how to make them a cross-platform app using Cordova because it used web technologies. The biggest challenge was probably using a web API, which I had never done before. It wasn't a great app, but it worked. It was more like a glorified website.

In 2013, I started making a Cordova app for a job. I hit the limits of what a web app wrapped inside a native app can do. It was slow, buggy, and limited. I had to patch together several Cordova plugins to make it all work. Each plugin has a native Android piece of code, a native iOS piece of code, and a JavaScript facade. I was still on an Android phone at the time, but I tried to learn Objective-C and iOS development from the Code School course. I liked some parts of it, but it seemed too overwhelming. I also tried to learn Angular and Backbone from Code School and failed to really grasp the concepts or make anything useful. But to be fair, I was really busy working overtime to get this app completed on time.

During this time, I went to a Startup Weekend and learned about static website generators like Jekyll. I loved the idea and starting using Jekyll for all my side projects. I also started learning vim because I saw someone using it and thought it was super cool how he was really efficient at manipulating text and didn't have to use a mouse.

In 2014 I officially became a JavaScript developer instead of PHP and starting using D3 full time to make really cool interactive visualization for the web. I loved this job. During this time (while my wife was in Chicago learning UX design) I [converted our church website from WordPress to Jekyll](https://github.com/lifestonechurch/lifestonechurch.net/commit/64d2a84ba5cd3d7b524183434fe2183f0043c48a). After 2 years, the company's priorities changed and I was forced to switch teams and learn Angular. I don't know why, but I hated it. I started to hate going into work and couldn't wait until I could leave each day. I felt very unproductive and unsupported. Thankfully there was an opening on the mobile web team working with React, which I was fascinated by. I was also tempted to work on the iOS team (even though I used an Android phone) because I thought the new Swift language looked really nice. I absolutely loved working in React for about a year but didn't feel like my values aligned with the company's values anymore, so I left.

I took a few months off and I [converted our church website from Jekyll to Gatsby](https://github.com/lifestonechurch/lifestonechurch.net/commit/ceac080607ba2d3a1108cdc347eb2d8b3052bf2c). I also played around with learning React Native because I knew and loved React and I wanted to make native apps.

Then I got a job as a React contractor. I loved the first company I worked for. I got to make a lot of cool components. They had a Ruby on Rails backend and a frontend with React, Redux, and Bootstrap. I was slowly moving them away from Bootstrap to React components styled with Emotion. I also introduced them to Storybook for building **visual** components in isolation. But I didn't get very far before I had to switch companies and I didn't enjoy the next 2 companies I had to work at. I didn't like their product, agree with their values, and I didn't understand the technologies or languages I had to work with. And I had no choice in the matter. My employer told me which company I had to work at and for how long. And that company told me what to work on and what language and tools to use. And I wouldn't be there long enough to make request any changes. I learned that I want autonomy and I want to believe in the product.

My next job was much better. I got to use React and make changes because I was a full-time, long-term employee. But unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the backend work. I want to make the thing you can see and touch. I want it to look cute, beautiful, or cool. And I don't want to maintain servers or worry about scaling and alerts.

That is why I'm studying to become an iOS developer. It's visual and interactive. I can make my own apps. And I can [teach others](https://adam.garrett-harris.com/2021-08-21-providing-access-to-directories-in-ios-with-bookmarks/) as I learn.
