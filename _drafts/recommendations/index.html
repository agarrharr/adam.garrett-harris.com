<h2>Vim Books</h2>

<p>I'm currently reading both of these books and really enjoying them. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D7JJGQK/?tag=adahar09-20">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a> is obviously a hard read, but good. It's also <a href="http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/">available online for free</a>, but I've enjoyed having a physical copy.</p>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKQSGWE/?tag=adahar09-20"><img border="0" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/recommendations/dasKeyboard.jpg" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=adahar09-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00JKQSGWE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

<p>I really have enjoyed my first mechanical keyboard, which is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKQSGWE/?tag=adahar09-20">Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate Clicky</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=adahar09-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00JKQSGWE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It has no numbers or letters on the keys, which forces me to use the keyboard correctly, and to learn where all the keys are (even the less used ones). I also love the feel of the clicky keys. It just feels really nice to use. Also, it feels really durable and well made. It's a keyboard I'm proud to have on my desk.</p>
