With this plugin you can add a widget to your site that shows books from one of the shelves on your Google Books Library. You can choose to show your Reading Now, Favorites, Have Read, or To Read shelves. You can also choose the maximum number of books that you want to display.

You can download it from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-bookshelves/).

If you would like to contribute, you can [fork the project on github](https://github.com/aharris88/google-bookshelves).
