> tl;dr Scoring in Saboteur 2 is a little confusing, so I made a little widget to help me figure out who wins.

The rules for figuring out who wins at the end of round of Saboteur 2 can be a little confusing, so I made a widget to help me figure it out.

If you're interested, her is what the instructions say:

The saboteurs win if there is **NOT** an uninterrupted ROUTE from the start to the treasure. Otherwise, some of the dwarfs win **and** all winning dwarfs in play split the treasure (see below).

When the dwarfs win:

- The **boss** and **profiteer** are always winners.
- A green dwarf is a winner if the ROUTE is **not** blocked by a blue door, **and**
    - A blue dwarf did **not** place the path card that completed the ROUTE, or
    - A blue dwarf placed the path card that completed the ROUTE **and** it is blocked by a green door.
- A blue dwarf is a winner if the ROUTE is **not** blocked by a green door, **and**
    - A green dwarf did **not** place the path card that completed the ROUTE, or
    - A green dwarf placed the path card that completed the ROUTE **and** it is blocked by a blue door.

Note: Both green and blue dwarfs can win if a saboteur, boss, geologist, profiteer placed the path card that completed the ROUTE. A trapped player never gets gold and does not count as a winner.
