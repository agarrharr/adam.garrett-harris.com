I just started a new podcast called BookBytes with a few other developers: [Safia Abdalla](https://twitter.com/captainsafia), [Jen Luker](https://twitter.com/knitcodemonkey), and [Jason Staten](https://twitter.com/statenjason). We plan on reading books that are interesting to developers, whether it's about coding, soft skills, UX design, or something else interesting, and then talking about the book with each other. And hopefully, once we've read and talked about the book, we'll chat with the author.

The first book we're reading is [Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.orbit.fm/bookbytes/1). I hope you enjoy it!
