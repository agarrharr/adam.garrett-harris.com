I made this for my good friend who happens to be my wife's best friend. She's theÂ Religion Editor at Tyler Morning Telegraph. This is just a very simple site where she can post her resume and let people get in contact with her.

The theme is based off of <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/clean-home/" target="_blank">Clean Home</a>.
