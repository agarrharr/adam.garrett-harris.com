I started using Amazon Affiliate links to see if I can earn a little money from my websites and when you go to get a link for a product, you end up with something really long and hard to understand like this:

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1NEUKK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00M1NEUKK&linkCode=as2&tag=adahar09-20&linkId=EPDKEC4OQ7GJWBYL](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1NEUKK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00M1NEUKK&linkCode=as2&tag=adahar09-20&linkId=EPDKEC4OQ7GJWBYL)

But I wanted to know what part of this link is actually important and figure out the fastest way to create a working affiliate link. Thankfully Amazon provides a [tool to check links](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/tools/link-checker/main.html).

It turns out that all I need is:

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1NEUKK/?tag=adahar09-20](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1NEUKK/?tag=adahar09-20)

where adahar09-20 is my Amazon Associates tracking id.

So all you have to do is take any amazon link and add ?tag=adahar09-20 (or &tag=adahar09-20 if there is already a ? character in the url). Of course, use your tracking id instead of mine.

And if in doubt, just use the [link checker](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/tools/link-checker/main.html).
