I just launched a new site for my best friend to promote a Bible study he's hosting for 20 something year olds called 20something. I actually used the <a href="http://themespectrum.com/premium-themes/parallax/" target="_blank">Parallax theme fromÂ Spectrum</a>.

<a href="http://www.adamwadeharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20something-paralax.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-245" alt="20something-paralax" src="{{site.url}}/assets/uploads/2013/02/20something-paralax.gif" width="300" height="168" /></a>

<a href="http://www.20somethingerath.com/" target="_blank">Live site</a>
