A coworker of mine, pointed out an awesome new feature of Chrome Devtools. When you have a css transtition in the styles pane, you may notice a new icon next to it:

![Css controls icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploads/2015/03/cssControlsIcon.png)

And when you click it, you get this awesome, drag and drop interface for adjusting your transition:

![Css controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/uploads/2015/03/cssControls.png)

This should be very handy for fine-tuning your animations and I'm sure designers will love being able to adjust the animation exactly when working with a developer.
