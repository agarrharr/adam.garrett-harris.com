I recently got to help my friend Robert install and customize a new theme for his church's website. It uses the <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/churchope-responsive-wordpress-theme/2708562" target="_blank">Churchope</a> theme, which is a great responsive theme for churches. It has a lot of great features built in like an event countdown timer.
