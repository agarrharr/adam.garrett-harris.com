<p style="text-align: left;">This is a responsive site that I made for my best friend. Since the whole point of the website is to display his resume, I decided to use the WP Resume plugin, which give a nice and easy way of entering and displaying resume data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I made a child theme based on a theme called Esquire, because it had the scrolling effect I was looking for where the right side of the page scrolls while the left side stays put.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="jonathan-resume-scroll" src="{{site.url}}/assets/uploads/2013/02/jonathan-resume-scroll.gif" width="300" height="168" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you resize the window or view it on a smartphone, it switches to a single-column layout and the scrolling is normal. Also, the download and email links become text instead of icons.</p>
