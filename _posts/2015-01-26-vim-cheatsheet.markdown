**Update**- I've updated the cheatsheet [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/updated-vim-cheatsheet/)

I was talking to [my friend who works in IT](https://twitter.com/JToTheRebellion) and occasionally has to use vim. And he hates it. He said that they have a little handwritten cheatsheet by the keyboard to help them out, but I thought it might be nice to make a beautiful cheatsheet that just gives the barebone essentials for people that have to use vim (or vi), but don't want to. So I asked my [wife](https://twitter.com/bec_bec1) to design it for me. There is dark version and also a light version in case you want to print it.
