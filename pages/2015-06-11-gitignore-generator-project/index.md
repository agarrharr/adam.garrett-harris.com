I was hanging out in Chicago while [my wife](https://twitter.com/bec_bec1) was in class [learning web design](http://www.rebeccadianeharris.com/getting-started-with-design/), and I thought I would make a website to generate a `.gitignore` file as quickly as possible. So I used the github API, to grab data from [a repo with a list of gitignore examples](https://github.com/github/gitignore) and I made [this site](http://www.adamwadeharris.com/gitignore-generator/).

I don't know how useful it is, but it was fun to make something by myself from start to finish in just a few hours. It was also fun to use jQuery again, which I haven't used in a long time.
