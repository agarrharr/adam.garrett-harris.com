I just launched the app for <a href="http://paradigmchurch.com/" target="_blank">Paradigm Church</a> with pulls data from their website (<a href="http://paradigmchurch.com">paradigmchurch.com</a>). It allows them to log into their website and add announcements, event registrations, and directions that show up in the app.

Here's all the technical details:

It pulls the data in json format, thanks to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/" target="_blank">JSON API plugin</a> and the Event Espresso API plugin from <a href="http://eventespresso.com/" target="_blank">Event Espresso</a>. It uses <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/" target="_blank">jQuery Mobile</a> for the framework, and I used <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">handlebars.js</a> for putting the json data into templates. I used <a href="https://trigger.io/" target="_blank">trigger.io</a> to build the applications.

Originally I was using phonegap build inside of Dreamweaver CS6, but trigger.io was so much easier. It automatically lets other apps take over appropriate links and it automatically installs the app on my phone when it's plugged in instead of having to scan a QR code. It also works really great with the Android emulator and the iOS simuator.
